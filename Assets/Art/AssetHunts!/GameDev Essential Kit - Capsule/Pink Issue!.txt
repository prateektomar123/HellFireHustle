Are you seeing pink materials after importing this Asset Pack?

🟥 Issue:
This happens when your project is using a different Render Pipeline than the default.

🟩 Fix:

01. Go to the Convert Render Pipeline folder inside the asset pack.

02. Open either the [URP] or [HDRP] .unitypackage based on the render pipeline you're using.
